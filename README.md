# Terminus Decoupled Kit Plugin

The Terminus Decoupled Kit Plugin provides commands useful for creating decoupled projects on [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io) using pre-configured starter kits.

The `decoupled-kit:create` command guides you through the following tasks:
* Creating a new site on Pantheon for the CMS back-end of your choice.
* Optionally installing your CMS.
* Creating a front-end codebase that sources data from your newly created CMS project. This codebase will be automatically configured for local development, and can later be deployed to Pantheon using the [import repository workflow](https://docs.pantheon.io/guides/decoupled/no-starter-kit/import-repo).

## Requirements
* [Terminus](https://docs.pantheon.io/terminus/install)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
## Installation

```
terminus self:plugin:install pantheon-systems/terminus-decoupled-kit-plugin
```

## Commands

### decoupled-kit:create

Creates a back-end CMS site on Pantheon and a front-end codebase that sources data from the CMS site.

To run interactively:

```
terminus decoupled-kit:create
```

#### Command Arguments

The following arguments can be provided to the decoupled-kit:create command:

```
decoupled-kit:create [options] [--] <site_name> <label> [<upstream_id>]
```
| Argument    | Description           |
| ---------   | --------------------- |
| site_name   | Site name             |
| label       | Site label            |
| upstream_id | Upstream name or UUID |


Example:

```
decoupled-kit:create <site> <label> <upstream>
```
Creates a new site named `site`, human-readably labeled `label`, using code from `upstream`.

#### Command Options

Additional options are available to further customize the decoupled-kit:create command:

| Option                | Description    |
| --------------------- | -------------- |
| --org[=ORG]           | Organization name, label, or ID   |
| --region[=REGION]     | The region to create the site in. See [the Pantheon regions documentation](https://pantheon.io/docs/regions#create-a-new-site-in-a-specific-region-using-terminus) for details. |
| --cms[=CMS]           | The CMS to use. Currently supported: drupal, wordpress |
| --install-cms[=INSTALL-CMS] | Whether to install the CMS. Defaults to true. |


Example:

```
decoupled-kit:create <site> <label> <upstream> --org=<org> --cms<cms> --install-cms<install-cms> --region<region>
```

Creates a new site named `site`, human-readably labeled `label`, associated with `organization`, for the specified `cms`.

## Related Projects

* [Create Pantheon Decoupled Kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-pantheon-decoupled-kit) - NodeJS CLI used to create and upgrade front-end codebases based on Pantheon starter kits. Used by this terminus plugin and can also be used independently.

## Known Limitations
* Currently this terminus plugin creates your front-end codebase, but does not automatically deploy it to Pantheon. You can deploy your front-end codebase to Pantheon using the [import repository workflow](https://docs.pantheon.io/guides/decoupled/no-starter-kit/import-repo).
